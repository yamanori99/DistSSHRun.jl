# Drive API — session, sync!, instantiate!, setup!, size!,
# drive!, collect!, pipeline!.
# Result types live in `drive/types.jl` (included from `DistSSHRun.jl` before `setup/`).
# Worker execution core lives in `drive/runtime/` (included from `DistSSHRun.jl`
# after heartbeat.jl). Worker bootstrap is `include_string` / `Core.eval` on
# Main so remotes do not need DistSSHRun.
